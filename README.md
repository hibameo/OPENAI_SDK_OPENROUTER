🌐 What is OpenRouter?

OpenRouter is a service that lets you access multiple AI models (like GPT-4, Claude, Mistral, Gemini, etc.) using a single API key and endpoint.

It’s like a hub that “routes” your prompts to different large language models (LLMs), so you can easily switch between them in one app.
